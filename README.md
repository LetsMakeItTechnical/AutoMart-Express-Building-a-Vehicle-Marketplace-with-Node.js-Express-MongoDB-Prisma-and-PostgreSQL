Challenge Title: "AutoMart Express: Building a Vehicle Marketplace with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Prisma, and PostgreSQL"
==========================================================================================================================

Challenge Description:
----------------------

Welcome to this intermediate-level challenge aimed at providing you with comprehensive hands-on experience on building a complete vehicle marketplace platform similar to Auto Trader. This challenge will guide you through creating APIs, managing CRUD operations, and later migrating your database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL using Prisma.

Prerequisites:
--------------

-   A basic understanding of JavaScript.
-   Node.js and npm installed in your system.
-   MongoDB installed in your system or MongoDB Atlas account.
-   PostgreSQL installed in your system or a PostgreSQL cloud database account.
-   Prisma installed in your system.

Learning Objectives:
--------------------

1.  Learn how to set up a server using Node.js and Express.js.
2.  Understand how to connect to MongoDB and manage CRUD operations.
3.  Learn to define complex schemas and models using mongoose.
4.  Learn how to migrate a MongoDB database to PostgreSQL using Prisma.
5.  Gain understanding on handling complex queries with Prisma and PostgreSQL.

Challenge Steps:
----------------

1.  Setup Your Project: Initialize a new Node.js project and install necessary packages: express, mongoose, and body-parser.
2.  Create a Server: Set up your server using Express.js.
3.  Connect to MongoDB: Use mongoose to connect your application to MongoDB.
4.  Create Vehicle and User Schemas: Define schemas for your users and vehicles.
5.  Implement CRUD operations: Create routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users and vehicles.
6.  Setup Prisma: Install Prisma and setup the necessary Prisma configurations for PostgreSQL.
7.  Migrate Database: Migrate your MongoDB database to PostgreSQL using Prisma.
8.  Refactor CRUD operations: Update your CRUD operations to use Prisma and PostgreSQL instead of mongoose and MongoDB.

Additional Features:
1.  TypeScript Integration: Throughout the challenge, the primary language used will be TypeScript. TypeScript provides static types for JavaScript, enabling you to catch potential bugs earlier, use powerful features like generics and interfaces, and leverage great tooling support with autocompletion and type checking. As a part of this feature, you'll be converting JavaScript code to TypeScript, setting up a `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compiler options, and managing the TypeScript build process.

The other features remain the same:
--------------------

1.  User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user registration, login and access roles. Certain features like posting a vehicle ad should be restricted to authenticated users only.
2.  Search Functionality: Enable users to search vehicles by various parameters like make, model, year, price, etc.
3.  Image Uploads: Allow users to upload images of the vehicles they are selling.
4.  Vehicle Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for vehicles they have purchased.
5.  Pagination: Implement pagination to limit the number of vehicle listings retrieved at once.
6.  User Profiles: Implement user profiles where users can view their vehicle listings and messages from prospective buyers.

Upon completion of this challenge, you will have built a complete vehicle marketplace platform powered by Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. This will be an excellent showcase of your full-stack development abilities and can be a significant addition to your portfolio. Happy coding!
